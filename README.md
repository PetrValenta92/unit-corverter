## Overview

### The project

Users should be able to:

- Input a number (**the limit is five-digit!**) and get the conversion.
- See converted values of length, volume and mass.
- Input only numerals.
- Input a dot for decimals.
- See the light or dark design of the application, according to its browser settings.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS media queries
- CSS utility classes
- Vanilla JavaScript
  - addEventListener
  - template string
  - alert function
- Flexbox

### What I learned

On the project, I mainly practiced how to work with .addEventListener() method and template strings, and I learned an alert() function in JS. Also I practiced my knowledge of HTML and CSS and learned how to change webapp's modes between light and dark.

Media query for dark mode:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --container-bg-color: rgb(31 41 55);
    --converter-title-color: rgb(244 244 244);
    --unit-input-color: rgb(244 244 244);
    --unit-input-border-color: rgb(97 165 194);
    --unit-input-border-hover-color: rgb(244 244 244);
    --convert-btn-color: rgb(39 53 73);
    --convert-btn-hover-color: rgb(244 244 244);
    --convert-btn-border-hover-color: rgb(97 165 194);
    --unit-bg-color: rgb(39 53 73);
    --unit-title-color: rgb(97 165 194);
    --unit-text-color: rgb(244 244 244);
  }
}
```

The output of the conversion acording to user's input:

```js
function render(inputNum, foot, meter, gallon, liter, pound, kilo) {
  lengthOutputEl.textContent = `${inputNum} meters = ${foot.toFixed(
    3
  )} feet | ${inputNum} feet = ${meter.toFixed(3)} meters`;

  volumeOutputEl.textContent = `${inputNum} liters = ${gallon.toFixed(
    3
  )} gallons | ${inputNum} gallons = ${liter.toFixed(3)} liters`;

  massOutputEl.textContent = `${inputNum} kilos = ${pound.toFixed(
    3
  )} pounds | ${inputNum} pounds = ${kilo.toFixed(3)} kilos`;
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to add an option for users to choose exactly which conversion they are interested in. Furthermore, I would like to expand the offer of conversions and also I would like to add a switch button for users to choose between light and dark modes.
